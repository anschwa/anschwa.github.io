<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org97d94ed">
<p>
In 2021 I decided to go all-in on a 2013 (trashcan) Mac Pro I saw
listed on Craigslist. Some might have considered this to be a &ldquo;bad
move&rdquo; from the start, but I thought the 2013 Mac Pro was simply the
most amazing computer ever made and $950 seemed like an absolute
steal. I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Little did I know, the 2013 Mac Pro suffered from severe thermal
issues and I soon became one of the thousands of unhappy users
experiencing spontaneous freezing and crashes thought to be caused by
Apple&rsquo;s proprietary dual AMD FirePro GPUs.
</p>

<p>
If I was in the market for a new Mac, the right thing to do would have
been to get an M1 Mac mini. Not only are the M1 Macs faster, they are
also cheaper and consume significantly less energy<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. However, I
wasn&rsquo;t really in the market for a Mac, what I wanted was a server.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out my 2013 Mac Pro is a very compelling server. It is
extremely quiet, compact, and rocks a 12-core Intel Xeon E5 with 64GB
of ECC memory<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the thermal
issues and kernel panics, which made me skeptical of this machine&rsquo;s
viability as a reliable home server. So mostly, it sat on the self.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I decided to see if the Mac Pro could run Linux or maybe
even FreeBSD. My hope was that by running on a minimal &ldquo;headless&rdquo;
environment, I could avoid any stability issues due to the GPUs. I&rsquo;ve
been interested in trying out FreeBSD for a while because of two very
compelling features: ZFS and the base system.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
While ZFS has been available on Linux for several years now, I
consider that to be more &ldquo;piece of mind&rdquo; than anything else. I doubt
the Linux community will ever adopt ZFS as their primary file system.
Meanwhile, FreeBSD has proudly supported ZFS since 2008.
</p>

<p>
As a user, I really like the unified deployment model of the FreeBSD
base system. This provides a level of consistency and correctness in
the operating system that Linux deeply struggles with.

I decided to upgrade the CPU and RAM to the maximum
configuration originally offered by Apple. Back in 2013 this machine
would have cost over $8,000. Swapping out the CPU was a bit more
involved than a typical PC but the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac+Pro+Late+2013+CPU+Replacement/21947">iFixit guide</a> was really
comprehensive and the whole process took about two hours.
