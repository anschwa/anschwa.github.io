Hi, I graduated from [[https://earlham.edu/][Earlham College]] in 2018 with a BA in Computer
Science, minor in Philosophy, and a few semesters of Studio Ceramics.

Now I work for [[https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/mission-and-core-values][USCIS]] as a software engineer in the Refugee and Asylum directorate.

* Books

Up next is:
- /Being and Nothingness/ by Jean-Paul Sartre
- /Either/Or/ by SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard

Check out what else [[file:books/index.org][I've been reading]].

* Work                                                             :noexport:

* Resume / CV
Previously I've enjoyed keeping [[file:cv/index.org][my resume]] in LaTeX, but now I prefer
using HTML with a custom [[file:cv/print.css][print.css]] file.
