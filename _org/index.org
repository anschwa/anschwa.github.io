Hi, I graduated from [[https://earlham.edu/][Earlham College]] in 2018 with a BA in Computer
Science, minor in Philosophy, and a few semesters of Studio Ceramics.

* Books
I'm currently reading /Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks/, by Friedrich Nietzsche.

Up next is:
- /The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition/ by Theodore Roszak
- /Either/Or/ by Søren Kierkegaard
- /Elixir in Action/ by Saša Jurić

Check out what else [[https://github.com/anschwa/books][I've been reading]].

I'm building the future of healthcare communication at [[https://www.diagnotes.com/][Diagnotes]].

* Resume / CV
Previously I've enjoyed keeping [[file:cv/index.org][my resume]] in LaTeX, but now I prefer
using HTML with a custom [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Printing#using_a_print_style_sheet][print.css]] file.
