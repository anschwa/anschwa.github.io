Hi, I graduated from [[https://earlham.edu/][Earlham College]] in 2018 with a BA in Computer
Science, minor in Philosophy, and a few semesters of Studio Ceramics.

* Books
I'm currently reading /The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on
the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition/, by Theodore
Roszak.

Up next is:
- /The Genealogy of Morals/ by Friedrich Nietzsche
- /Either/Or/ by SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard

Check out what else [[https://github.com/anschwa/books][I've been reading]].

I'm building the future of healthcare communication at [[https://www.diagnotes.com/][Diagnotes]].

* Resume / CV
Previously I've enjoyed keeping [[file:cv/index.org][my resume]] in LaTeX, but now I prefer
using HTML with a custom [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Printing#using_a_print_style_sheet][print.css]] file.
