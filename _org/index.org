Hi, I graduated from [[https://earlham.edu/][Earlham College]] in 2018 with a BA in Computer
Science, minor in Philosophy, and a few semesters of Studio Ceramics.

I have a passion for programming languages, web development, privacy, and Emacs.

** Books
I'm currently reading /Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks/, by Friedrich Nietzsche.

Check out what else [[https://github.com/anschwa/books][I've been reading]].

** Work
I currently work at [[https://www.diagnotes.com/][Diagnotes]] as a software engineer.
