* Talks
** June 18. 2020: /Why Emacs?/, Dotfiles-Indy
- What’s the deal with Emacs? I thought Vim was better anyway? Why
  should I switch from Visual Studio Code? Emacs is weird. Let’s take
  a look at what makes Emacs unique and highlight how it has inspired
  the software we use everyday.

** June 16, 2020: /Using build tags in Go/, Golang Indianapolis
- When it comes to compiling your programs, Go has a few tricks up its
  sleeve. Build tags are a versatile tool that provide a means to
  conditionally compile files into your Go program. In this talk we
  will write a make-believe serverless function that uses build tags
  to substitute ~package main~ so that we can develop and debug our
  program locally, while being able to deploy a “pure” production
  binary. As a bonus, we will look at setting package variables using
  the ~ldflags -X~ option (see ~go doc cmd/link~).

** April 16, 2020: /Keep it Simple Dotfiles/, Dotfiles-Indy
- How I manage my dotfiles without any symlinks using a "bare" git repository.

** January 8, 2020: /Emacs and the Joy of Text Editing/, Indy.rb
- Let’s explore text editing as a tool for thought as we examine the
  way of EMACS. This talk covers the history of text editors as well
  as what sets them apart from commercial software and IDEs.

** October 23, 2019: /Using "replace"/, Golang Indianapolis
- Go modules give some flexibility for controlling which version of a
  dependency gets built in your app, however, these mechanisms are not
  obvious. This talk sets out to demonstrate some of the abilities of
  ~replace~, ~exclude~, and ~go get~ under modules for substituting package
  versions or branches on the fly.

** August 21, 2019: /Lightning Talk: Using "go present"/, Golang Indianapolis
- ~present~ is a neat tool that offers some unique features for giving
  talks about code. This talk covers how to embed images, websites,
  and live source code into your presentation as well as address some
  of the trade-offs you have to make when choosing ~present~ over
  traditional slide-making software.

** July 10, 2018: /Don’t Forget To Have Fun/, IndyPy
- It’s easy to get lost and overwhelmed with software development and
  start to lose interest or motivation when working on projects. I've
  found it helpful to mix things up and remember to spend time on
  things you enjoy. This talk shares some of the ways I have been
  managing my happiness and how it's impacted my work.
