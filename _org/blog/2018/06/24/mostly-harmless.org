* Mostly Harmless
/The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/ is one of my favorite books.
Douglas Adams was heavily influenced by society's ever growing
dependence on technology and the unintended side effects of automated
systems. In this way, the C programming language truly embodies the
spirit of Adam's work.

#+CAPTION: A mostly harmless program:
#+BEGIN_SRC C :eval never-export :results output :exports both
#include <stdio.h>

#define SIX 1+5
#define NINE 8+1

int main() {
    printf("%d * %d = %d\n", SIX, NINE, SIX * NINE);
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS[9c9568cf4742e2fd062c32a32f3572a9141e5324]:
: 6 * 9 = 42

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's point of
view without the proper training."
