* Using an EdgeRouter for my Home Network
A couple of years ago I was given a very nice Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite
but never set it up. Although I have accumulated a variety of
networking gear and experimented with running small web servers at
home for a long time, I had always used typical consumer routers like
the Linksys WRT54G or Apple AirPort Express.

Recently, after moving into a new apartment I decided it was time to
give the EdgeRouter a try. I have been very impressed with the results
and become quite proud of my new home-lab.

* Devices
Think about your devices. This is the most important step in setting
up your home network.

* Network
- Router: Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite 3
- Managed Switch: TPlink SG-108pe
- Access Points (WiFi): TPLink EAP225 Omada

* Basic Router Setup
Reset the EdgeRouter to the default configuration and login to the web
interface to get started. It is a good idea to run the basic setup
because it will give you a fully functioning home router.

Connect to the EdgeRouter on ~eth0~ and open a web browser to
~192.168.1.1~. The default username and password is ~ubnt~.

You might need to assign yourself to an IP within the default subnet, like ~192.168.1.42~.

Don't forget to create a new admin user during the initial setup. This
will also remove the default ~ubnt~ user from the EdgeRouter.

After the EdgeRouter reboots, you will need to re-connect to ~eth1~.
You can connect a modem to ~eth0~ and you should have internet access.
The basic setup wizard defines an appropriate firewall ruleset that
prevents unauthorized inbound connections to your home network.

** Configure SSH
Standard SSH key configuration, except you can't use ~ssh-copy-id~ and
have to use the ~loadkey~ command from within EdgeOS.

Create new ssh key for managing the EdgeRouter:
#+begin_src text
ssh-keygen -t ed_25519 -C "email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/path/edge-id_ed25519
#+end_src

Copy key to EdgeRouter (only ~/tmp~ is writable):
#+begin_src text
scp ~/.ssh/path/edge-id_ed25519.pub user@192.168.1.1:/tmp
#+end_src

Then access the EdgeRouter console and load your key:
#+begin_src text
configure
loadkey <user> /tmp/edge-id_25519.pub
commit
save
exit
#+end_src

Now add a new entry in ~$HOME/.ssh/config~ and test the connection.

Try to ~ssh~ into your new admin account and verify the ownership of your home directory:
#+begin_src text
ssh <user>@192.168.1.1

ls -la

# if needed run
sudo chmod -R <user> /home/<user>
#+end_src

Finally, you can disable password based login to the router:
#+begin_src text
configure
set service ssh disable-password-authentication
commit
save
exit
#+end_src

** Initial Configuration
Poke around in the web UI and do some quick initial configuration
using the System tab at the bottom of the page.

- Set host name
- Set timezone
- Disable analytics
- Disable UISP
- Disable UBNT Discovery
- Update firmware if available

** Enable Hardware Offloading
#+begin_src text
configure

set system offload ipv4 forwarding enable
set system offload ipv4 gre enable
set system offload ipv4 pppoe enable
set system offload ipv4 vlan enable
set system offload ipv4 bonding enable

set system offload ipv6 forwarding enable
set system offload ipv6 pppoe disable
set system offload ipv6 vlan enable

set system offload ipsec enable

commit
save
exit
#+end_src


* Firewall
From the Ubiquiti's EdgeRouter documentation:
 #+begin_quote
A Zone-Based Firewall assigns each interface to a specific zone. The
firewall zones will be used to define what traffic is allowed to flow
between the interfaces. The traffic that originates in the EdgeRouter
itself will also be assigned to a zone: the local zone.
#+end_quote

*REMEMBER TO DISCONNECT THE EDGE ROUTER FROM THE INTERNET BEFORE CHANGING THE FIREWALL*

My home network has quickly evolved from a single subnet to an
environment with several VLAN's and multiple wireless networks.

I decided that a zone-based firewall policy was going to offer the
best trade-offs: More complicated to setup, but conceptually much
simpler. Hopefully this makes things easier to maintain and less
likely to get wrong.

I want several layers of isolation:
1. A ~HOME~ network for personal and guest devices. This will be the main
   network, but none of these devices should have management access to
   the router or establish connections to outside subnets or vlans.
2. A ~WORK~ network. Only work devices are allowed on this network. Same rules as home, but for work.
3. An "untrusted" ~DMZ~. More restrictive network than home or work.
4. Trusted network for management (~MGMT~). Access to the router, switches, and access points are limited to this network.

[[file:img/network-interfaces.png][file:img/network-interfaces.png]]

** Rules
Each zone is defined using a combination of the following firewall
rule sets. Each rule set provides support for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

Firewall rule names are limited to 28 characters.

*** Prevent Unauthorized Inbound Traffic from the Internet
Only allow valid and established connections. Log unauthorized requests.

#+begin_src text

#+end_src

*** Internet Access
The typical thing to do is allow any outgoing traffic to reach the
internet. However, I want to block certain devices from ever being
able to communicate to the outside world, such as my printer and
"smart" TV.

#+begin_src text

*** Allow Pi-hole
I use Pi-hole for local DNS so I need to allow incoming queries to the
management network. Otherwise, it should only allow valid and
established connections and log any unauthorized requests.

*** Restrict Management Access
Do not allow management access to the EdgeRouter. Log unauthorized requests.

This rule will be used to define what local traffic is allowed into
the EdgeRouter. For now this means only DHCP requests.

** Zones
A zone must define how to handle incoming traffic from every other
zone in the network. This is part of what makes a zone-based firewall
robust and resilient to mistakes. Any flow of traffic between two
zones that has not been defined (at both ends!) will get dropped.

* VLAN
** Tagged, Untagged, and Not Member.
Tagging a VLAN ID to a port allows devices that support VLAN tagging
(such as your access point) to route packets according to their tag.

Setting a port as "untagged" for a VLAN ID will let "regular" devices
receive traffic from the specified VLAN(s).

When a port is set to not be a member of a VLAN ID, traffic on that
VLAN will not get sent to that port.

For example, the TP-Link TL-SG108PE has management access only on
~VLAN 1~. If you want your computer to have access to the management
interface, the switch port you plug you computer into must be marked
as "untagged". If you want to restrict access to the management
interface on the switch, all of the other ports must set ~VLAN 1~ as "Not Member".

** TP-Link TL-SG108PE
1. Set enable ~802.1Q VLAN~.
2. Use the ~802.1Q PVID~ tab to configure the VLAN ID for untagged ports.

This table represents a VLAN configuration where ports 1, 2, 3, 4, and
8 all belong to the management network and will receive traffic for
all VLAN IDs.

Ports 5, 6, and 7 will only receive traffic tagged for VLAN 2, however
the ports must be marked as "untagged" on the switch so that regular
devices (computers, printers, etc.) will get the packets.

Additionally, ports 5, 6, and 7 have been removed as members for VLAN
1 and 3 so that traffic from my ~MGMT~ and ~WORK~ network will not end
up on devices intended to be used on the ~HOME~ network.

| VLAN ID | VLAN Name | Member Ports | Tagged Ports | Untagged Ports |
|---------+-----------+--------------+--------------+----------------|
|       1 | Default   | 1-4,8        |              | 1-4,8          |
|       2 | Home      | 1-8          | 1-4,8        | 5-7            |
|       3 | Work      | 1-4,8        | 1-4,8        |                |

* DHCP
Each network gets its own interface and subnet to make it easier to
see where devices are connected.

Static IP address assignments are managed through DHCP reservations.

| Network | Interface | Subnet         |
|---------+-----------+----------------|
| mgmt    | eth1      | 192.168.1.1/24 |
| home    | eth1.2    | 10.0.2.1/24    |
| work    | eth1.3    | 10.0.3.1/24    |
| dmz     | eth2      | 172.16.1.1/24  |

** Static Reservations
| Name                |          IP |
|---------------------+-------------|
| TL-SG108PE (Switch) | 192.168.1.2 |
| pihole              | 192.168.1.3 |
| EAP225-home (AP)    | 192.168.1.4 |
| EAP225-office (AP)  | 192.168.1.5 |
| ML-2955DW (Printer) |   10.0.2.13 |

* Using Pi-hole for DNS

I use Pi-hole for my home DNS server. It lives on the management
network and can is the only DNS entry for each DHCP server on the
EdgeRouter.

In order to use pi-hole across different network subnets you have to
enable the option ~Bind only to interface eth0~ on the DNS settings
page.

[[file:img/pihole-dns.png][file:img/pihole-dns.png]]

* WiFi & Access Points
- 5GHz only
- Broadcast at lowest power
- Each network is on a separate vlan and subnet
- Each access point is on a non-interfering channel

* AirPlay, Printing, and mDNS
You can use "mDNS repeating" to allow access to airplay and printing
across subnets/vlans. This can be enabled using the Config Tree tab
and going to ~Services -> mDNS~.

You must enable at least two interfaces.

#+begin_src text
configure

set service mdns repeater interface eth1
set service mdns repeater interface eth1.2

commit
save
exit
#+end_src

* Bufferbloat and Smart Queue Management (SQM)

The EdgeRouter supports Smart Queue Management, which can reduce the overall latency of your internet connection.

1. Go to QoS tab
2. Add a new smart queue policy
3. Set WAN interface to ~eth0~
4. Set upload and/or download bandwidth to 20% of internet speedtest results
