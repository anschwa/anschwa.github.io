My personal website, powered by [[https://golang.org/][go]] and hosted on [[https://pages.github.com/][github-pages]].

* Development
#+BEGIN_SRC text
git clone git@github.com:anschwa/anschwa.github.io.git
cd anschwa.github.io
pipenv install # pip install pipenv
vgo run app.go # go get -u golang.org/x/vgo

# build static site
vgo run app.go -build
#+END_SRC

Or you can use [[https://github.com/pilu/fresh][fresh]] to automatically reload the app. You should
probably run =vgo build= first however.

* Content
=app.go= tries to use [[http://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] for rendering page content. If you don't
have it installed, page content is assumed to be =HTML=. This means
any document format supported by =pandoc= will be properly rendered on
the site, whether that be =org-mode=, =markdown=, or even =LaTeX=.

* Deployment
#+BEGIN_SRC text
cd anschwa.github.io
vgo run app.go -deploy -update
#+END_SRC

* TODO
- Get Archive working
- Each blog post should link to previous and next posts
- Make having a list of recent posts look nice
